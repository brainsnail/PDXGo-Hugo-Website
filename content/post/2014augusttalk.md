## August Talk Night!
Gather with other Gophers for an evening of Talks and discussion around Golang! All experience levels welcome, don't forget to bring your questions.  
      
The third Tuesday of August will probably be the night we have talk nights going forward. *Unless it falls on the same week as the project night..*
### Talks
Introductory/Beginner: TBD  
Reverse Q&A:  Bring your questions and ask the whole group in a discussion format! 

Esri R&D's Geobin: Learn how Esri wrangle gophers into displaying location data!

### Location
Esri R&D will be hosting us. The doors lock at 6:00, so please arrive before 7:00 to minimize elevator runs after the event starts.
