Portland Gophers Unite!

This group exists to help foster a community around using the Go programming language. We hope to act as a venue for learning the language, highlight community contributions and showcase the joy of programming.

We adhere to the Go community Code of Conduct - https://github.com/pdxgo/codeofconduct - and want anyone who is interested in attending to feel welcome!

Interested in giving a talk? Just fill out this form (https://goo.gl/forms/QPddhPEWwE8Vb7tK2) and submit an idea.
