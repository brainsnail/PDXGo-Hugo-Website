# Go 1.14 Release Party!

>This will be a virtual meetup. Join us at [https://www.crowdcast.io/e/pdx-go-march-12-2020](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/pdx-go-march-12-2020)

Okay, so COVID-19 happened and we're going to try a virtual meetup! There's no in-person element to this one, so just open up [the URL](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/pdx-go-march-12-2020) at 6pm PDT so we have time to sort out audio/visual stuff. We'll also have a chance to socialize in the chat before we get started.

Then, we'll start the release party at 6:10.

We'll talk about and demo what's added or changed in 1.14 and leave time to have some open ended discussion around it.

We might have some time to discuss what the next couple of months look like for the meetup - including maybe collaborating with the folks in Seattle to host a more traditional all-remote talk night (PNW Go?).

## Location

This meetup will be all virtual. We'll meet at [this link](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/pdx-go-march-12-2020). You won't need to download any specialized software ahead of time. Just come with a modern browser and questions.
